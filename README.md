# Multiclass_SVM
 Implement PCA to reduce the dimensionality of the images from 784 to a lower number of principal components (k = 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 500). 
 Then implemented soft SVM from scratch using stochastic gradient descent and used it create a multi-class classifier since there are 10 classes in MNIST dataset.
  Dataset used here is MNIST data set that conatins 10 classes.
